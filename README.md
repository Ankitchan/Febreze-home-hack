# Febreze-home-hack


# Abstract

## Executive Summary:
Amazon Alexa, Intel Edison, and Febrez air-freshner come together to do real time background check on the person standing outside the door using state of the art deep learning algorithm. Security never smelled better !
rts the crimes statistics at the granularity of the street level so as to make the user aware of the reported crimes. 


## Proposed Solution:
There would be a CCTV camera installed outside the door for live streaming. The resident will ask Alexa to check whoâ€™s at the door. Alexa will in turn push the request to our server which will do the background check on the visitor in real-time using our self-devised facial recognition software. Finally, Alexa will reply back to the resident with the identity of the visitor. An email notification would also be triggered to the resident with the image and the identity of the visitor.

Moreover, do you also want to know about the most dangerous streets according to the crime rate, wells, Alexa knows that too! When the resident asks Alexa for the crime rate with a specific zip code, Alexa would reply with the names of the most dangerous streets with the total number of crimes that has occurred on the streets in the last 24 hours. Moreover, Alexa would also inform the resident about the total number of different crimes like shooting, Robbery, Vandalism and any other kind of crime that has occurred at the granularity of street name.


## Target Audience:
1. Blind people
2. Deaf People
3. Home Owners
