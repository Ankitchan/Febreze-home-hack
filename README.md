# Febreze-home-hack


# Abstract

## Executive Summary:
Amazon Alexa, Intel Edison, and Febrez air-freshner come together to do real time background check on the person standing outside the door using state of the art deep learning algorithm.
User asks Echo if someone's at the door - Echo connects with Intel Edison board which is in-turn connected with a camera. A snapshot of the visitor is taken and processed by Django server using Amazon Rekognition API. Visitors are classified into 4 categories - family, friend, stranger and criminal. Echo device gives the voice output to the home owner about the identity of the visitor and a Smart Febrez Device releases a smell associated with that particular person. Thus, this project makes home utterly secure for people who would otherwise had not been able to see the visitor or listen to the echo device.

Security never smelled better !

## Target Audience:
1. Blind people
2. Deaf people
3. Home owners
